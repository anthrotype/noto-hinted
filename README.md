## Noto fonts hinted with ttfautohint.

This repository contains

  * hinted versions of (some) Noto fonts generated with

  * HTML test pages that embed the created fonts,

  * snapshot images of all HTML test pages, as rendered by Firefox, Chrome,
    and IE on MS Windows, and

  * a Makefile and some auxiliary files to (re)create the fonts, HTML
    test pages, and the snapshots.
